## Overview

To complete this challenge, I'll be using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) with [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

### The challenge

> Note: There aren't any tool / library restrictions for this challenge.

The challenge is to build out a dashboard to track users time spent on a particular activity. The time spent and period should update based on the active timeframe.

**Challenge Requirements:**

- [ ] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [ ] Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## Local Development

- Clone repo
  > SSH: git@github.com:Matt-MMCoding/time-tracking-dashboard.git

  > HTTPS: https://github.com/Matt-MMCoding/time-tracking-dashboard.git

- Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
- Run `yarn dev` to spin up local development server; default port `3000`.
- Run `yarn lint` to run eslint across files.
- Run `yarn prettier` to run prettier styling across files.

### Todo
- [ ] Add `yarn test` command to run Jest testing

## My process

> [Forward Thinking] This process may change as I progress but here is my planned process

- [x] Add eslint and prettier configs to enforce code pattern
- [ ] Create theme with `styled-components` v6
- [ ] Add Jest for unit testing
- [ ] Create 'User Profile' card with dummy data
- [ ] Pass supplied data to 'User Profile' card
- [ ] Create reusable 'Activity' card with dummy data
- [ ] Pass supplied data to 'Activity' card
- [ ] Create responsive layout for all cards
- [ ] Confirm frontend matches design
- [ ] Check accessibility for each element
- [ ] Publish via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

> Note: Not yet decided if `flex` or `grid` should be used here, initial thought is `grid`


### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
